					<p>LIT Review is a group of early career scientists and physicians-in-training committed to the art of scientific communication and presentation. We believe that as the next generation's scientists, physicians, and leaders, we have a
						responsibility to communicate our science in a manner that is clear, concise, and actionable. We believe training in scientific communication should begin as early as possible; moreover, with recent societal shifts towards remote
						communication, our scientific presentations need to be more polished and unambiguous than ever. In LIT Review, we broadly review literature within a field (of which we claim no expertise), present high-level overviews of select topics,
						and solicit discourse from our peers. Please tune in and join us on our journey towards communicative excellence!</p>

					<h2>Danica Dy</h2>
					<img class="pfp0" src="images/DanicaHeadshot.png" alt="Danica Profile Picture">
					<p>Hi there, welcome to LIT Review! My name is Danica Dy and I am a recent graduate (Class of 2020) from UNC-Chapel Hill. I received my BS in Biology with minors in Chemistry and Medicine, Literature, & Culture. I am an incoming PhD student
						for UNC’s Biological and Biomedical Sciences Program and am taking the next year of rotations to decide on my dedicated field of study. </p>
					<p>I started my research journey with summers in the Gilbride Lab at Ryerson University, studying antibiotic resistance in bacteria from aquatic environments. We were interested in studying the dissemination of resistance genes through
						waterways in urban and rural settings. I also spent a significant part of my undergraduate degree conducting research in Cell Biology and Physiology with the Caron Lab at UNC-Chapel Hill. I worked on projects that studied the
						Adrenomedullin-signaling axis on angiogenesis in mouse models, and looked at lymphangiogenesis phenotypes in Collaborative Cross mouse models.
						These biological research projects led me to question the broader implications of these research findings on global public health. </p>
					<p>
						Could understanding the dissemination of resistant genes through our waterways influence how we treat our water and what communities are at higher risk? Could differing levels of hormones across sexes or genetic diversity influence the
						signaling axis for
						lymphangiogenesis and thus affect risk for associated diseases and therapeutic development? Therefore, I am incredibly interested in applying biological and
						biomedical principles in the broader context of improving global public health. I hope that whichever field and career I decide on, I will be able to make a
						positive impact on human health and advance the understanding of pathophysiology so that we can provide advanced therapeutics and share information about disease
						prevention and mitigation through stronger health systems.</p>

					<h2>Timothy Qi</h2>
					<img class="pfp0" src="images/TimHeadshot.png" alt="Tim Profile Picture">
					<p>I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Biology and B.A. in Chemistry and am pursuing a career in clinical, quantitative, and systems pharmacology. In particular, I hope to innovate upon
						Model-Informed Drug Development paradigms such that the mechanisms, PK/PD, and clinical relevance of complex therapeutic platforms can be confidently evaluated across all stages of development. Through understanding these factors a
						priori, I endeavor to accelerate the translation of novel therapeutics from bench to bedside. Auxiliary to this process is the furthering of widespread acceptance of modeling and simulation by clinical and regulatory decision makers,
						which necessitates demystification of methodology and clear scientific communication. To this end, I founded LIT Review to facilitate the development of scientific communication skills.</p>

					<h2>Arvind Sivashanmugam</h2>
					<img class="pfp0" src="images/ArvindHeadshot.jpg" alt="Arvind Profile Picture">
					<p>I grew up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I completed my major in Biostatistics as well as minors in Spanish and Minor. I am now pursuing a Doctor of Medicine at the
						University of North Carolina School of Medicine. I have completed research in a variety of fields including research positions at the UNC Gene Therapy Center, UNC Collaborative Studies Coordinating Center, and the Duke Center for Smoking
						Cessation. These experiences have helped me maintain my presence in the intersections of fields and building a skill set that can effectively transverse unique professional settings. I have a specific interest in strengthening
						communication between sectors to create overarching improvements upon research and communities as I pursue a career as a physician-scientist.</p>

					<h2>Ryesa Amreen Mansoor</h2>
					<img class="pfp0" src="images/RyesaHeadshot.jpg" alt="Ryesa Profile Picture">
					<p>Hi everyone! My name is Ryesa. I’m a recent graduate from the UNC Chapel Hill Gillings School of Public Health, where I received my BSPH in Nutrition and a double minor in Neuroscience and Korean. I am currently a Post-baccalaureate
						Research Fellow at the NIMH working under the Section for Functional Imaging Methods.
						Building off of my past research experience, during my four years of undergrad I worked in two different neuroimaging-focused labs. My first lab was a cognitive neuroimaging lab where I worked on attention, learning, and cognition
						experiments using EEG and fMRI analysis. My most recent lab studied the neuropsychology of ingestive behaviors, where I worked on projects using fMRI to evaluate brain changes and learning in response to certain eating behaviors.
						I’m very interested in research that encompasses the intersectionality of various disciplines - like nutrition and neuroscience - that allow us to understand the microscopic and macroscopic bases of human behavior and health. After
						completing my 2 years at the NIH, I plan to attend medical school and receive a dual MD/MPH degree. I hope to continue studying human health and behavior from a public health perspective and apply this to patient care as a physician in
						the future.</p>

					<h2>Saurin Kantesaria</h2>
					<img class="pfp0" src="images/SaurinHeadshot.jpg" alt="Saurin Profile Picture" style="height: 16em; padding-bottom: 10px;">
					<p style="padding-bottom:70px;">Hello friends! My name is Saurin Kantesaria, I’m currently a 2nd year MD/PhD candidate (aka second year med student) at the University of Minnesota’s Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). I graduated
						from the joint biomedical engineering program between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. I did a lot of work back in college on building microdevices for cell sorting/culture, but now my
						focus is primarily on clinical imaging, specifically MRI! In my spare time I like dancing, playing animal crossing, and endlessly rewatching Avatar the Last Airbender.
